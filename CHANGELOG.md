# Changelog

Changes to the `nohead` gem that you can notice. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org): additive API changes are minor
releases; a change that could break your code is a major one. Each release's
section is its GitHub release's notes.

## 0.2.0

- Types follow the API's current contract. They add types only for
  operations an API key can't call, so no method changed.

## 0.1.0

The first release.

- `Nohead::Client`, with methods for every operation an API key can call:
  records (with revisions, scheduling, bulk changes and search),
  collections, fields and migrations, assets, webhooks and their deliveries,
  the audit log, feature flags.
- Results you read with methods or `[]`, pages that are Enumerable across
  every page, timestamps as Times.
- Typed errors per API error type, retries with idempotency keys,
  `if_match` and change notes.
- `assets.upload` in one call (paths or IO), and webhook verification
  (`Nohead::Webhooks.unwrap`). No runtime dependencies.
