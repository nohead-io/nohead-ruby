# Changelog

Changes to the `nohead` gem that you can notice. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org): additive API changes are minor
releases; a change that could break your code is a major one. Each release's
section is its GitHub release's notes.

## 0.3.0

- **Breaking:** the `datetime` field type is now `date`. A plain date field holds
  `YYYY-MM-DD`; with `include_time` it holds a moment, written in the field's
  `time_zone` when it has one. Field migrations take `time_zone`, the zone
  whose day each moment falls on when the time is removed.
- Boolean fields can't be `required`: a boolean is true or false, and no
  value reads as false.
- Text fields take a `format` (`email`, `url`, `slug`) and text and integer
  fields `unique`; a taken value's error detail has the `record_id` that has
  it (`code: "taken"`).
- Filters take operators: `{ price: { lt: 50 } }`, with `eq`, `ne`, `gt`,
  `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `in` (an array) and `exists`, and record lists sort by
  a field's value. Commas and backslashes in array values are escaped, so a
  value can hold a comma.

## 0.2.0

- Types follow the API's current contract. They add types only for
  operations an API key can't call, so no method changed.

## 0.1.0

The first release.

- `Nohead::Client`, with methods for every operation an API key can call:
  records (with revisions, scheduling, bulk changes and search),
  collections, fields and migrations, assets, webhooks and their deliveries,
  the audit log, feature flags.
- Results you read with methods or `[]`, pages that are Enumerable across
  every page, timestamps as Times.
- Typed errors per API error type, retries with idempotency keys,
  `if_match` and change notes.
- `assets.upload` in one call (paths or IO), and webhook verification
  (`Nohead::Webhooks.unwrap`). No runtime dependencies.
